After a long working day as the hero of TownyMcTownFace you go to your favorite restaurant ``The Pannekoekhui''. Sadly when the waitress gives you the plate with the pannenkoeken you were longing for todays hard work shows its downsides: Your arms not strong enough to hold the plate properly and it falls shattering into pieces. Not only your dreams of a tasty pannenkoeken shattered. The owner now wants you to repay the damage you caused by working in the kitchen. \\ \ \\
In the kitchen, the chef tells you to clean up the mess he created after he heard that you dropped one of her unbelievably tasteful pannenkoeken. You are standing in front of a pile of pannekoeken where some of the pannenkoeken are turned upside down. As the guests need their pannenkoeken served with the upside being correct, you now have to correct this mess thus all pannenkoeken are turned the correct way. The catch of your task is, that you only got one spatula and only one plate on which you are allowed to correct the mess. But using your inhuman swiftness of a hero you can always select $k$ top most pannenkoeken as a whole stack and turn this whole stack upside down. But remember, as your power of today is nearly depleted you can only make $n$ many moves until your power runs out, where $n$ is the number of pannekoeken in the stack. You are very confident that your power is enough to solve this task. Can you show the chef your best performance of your secret pannenkoeken turning skills?


\paragraph*{Input}\ \\
The first line contains $n$ $(1 \leq n \leq  5000)$, the number of pannenkoeken in the stack you need to turn upside. The next line contains a $n$-character long string made up from either 'u' or 'd'. 'u' stands for a upside (correctly) facing pannenkoeken, while 'd' stands for a downside facing pannenkoeken. The first pannenkoeken is the top most pannenkoeken of the stack.

\paragraph*{Output}\ \\
The first line should be an integer $k \leq n$ giving the number of turns you want to make to sort the pannenkoekens. The next line should now contain $k$ many values where $t_i$ represents that for turn $i$ you turn the $t_i$ upper most pannenkoeken upside down.
