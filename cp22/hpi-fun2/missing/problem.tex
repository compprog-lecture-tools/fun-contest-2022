After they left citadel space, Captain Anderson of the Normandy was attacked by unknown forces and escaped, separating from the rest of the fleet. While the rest of the fleet is still beyond the Kappa Iotta Mass Relay, they have now regrouped and have to decide how to proceed with their mission.

While the ship received a message from the rest of the fleet beyond the Kappa Iotta Mass Relay, it is encrypted. The ship's board computer can decrypt single words, the entire message is not decipherable, since the words have been transmitted together, with the spaces missing.

The decryption code ensures that every word is a palindrome, and every palindrome is a valid word. Can you help Anderson and the Normandy's crew to decipher the message by determining how many words are contained?

\paragraph*{Input}

A string $s$ of lowercase letters of length $n$, $1 \geq n \geq 2500$.

\paragraph*{Output}

The number of words in string $s$.
